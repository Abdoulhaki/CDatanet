\arguments{
\item{formula}{an object of class \link[stats]{formula}: a symbolic description of the model. The `formula` should be as for example \code{y ~ x1 + x2 | x1 + x2}
where `y` is the endogenous vector, the listed variables before the pipe, `x1`, `x2` are the individual exogenous variables and
the listed variables after the pipe, `x1`, `x2` are the contextual observable variables. Other formulas may be
\code{y ~ x1 + x2} for the model without contextual effects, \code{y ~ -1 + x1 + x2 | x1 + x2} for the model
without intercept or \code{ y ~ x1 + x2 | x2 + x3} to allow the contextual variable to be different from the individual variables.}

\item{contextual}{(optional) logical; if true, this means that all individual variables will be set as contextual variables. Set the
the `formula` as `y ~ x1 + x2` and `contextual` as `TRUE` is equivalent to set the formula as `y ~ x1 + x2 | x1 + x2`.}

\item{data}{an optional data frame, list or environment (or object coercible by \link[base]{as.data.frame} to a data frame) containing the variables
in the model. If not found in data, the variables are taken from \code{environment(formula)}, typically the environment from which `CDnetNPL` is called.}
}
\value{
A list consisting of:
    \item{theta0}{starting values.}
    \item{formula}{input value of `formula`.}
    \item{contextual}{input value of `contextual`.}
